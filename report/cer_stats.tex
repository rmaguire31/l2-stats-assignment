\section{Introduction}

Statistical analysis was used to identify the demand patterns of energy 
consumption in a range of homes on a summer and winter's day.

In 2009 the Irish Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) undertook a trial 
where smart meters were installed in 6256 homes \cite{martinsmart}. Those 
meters recorded the rate  of electrical energy consumption every half hour for 
a year.

This report analysed the total energy consumption for two days in the 
trial---the first day which occurred in the summer and the 200th day which 
occurred in the winter. In order to get an idea for the total energy 
consumption for each day, the half hourly consumption rates were summed for 
each meter.

Furthermore, it was noted a large number of meters recorded no energy 
consumption. This could have been due to the consumers being away from the 
premises or faulty meters. These meters were excluded from statistical 
analysis. 

\section{Demand Patterns}

Figure~\vref{fig:Data} shows the distribution of the total energy consumption 
for 6122 smart meters on day 1 of the trial which occurred in the summer and 
6207 smart meters on day 200 of the trial which occurred in the winter. The 
histograms do not include the meters which recorded no energy consumption that 
day.

    \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{Day200}
    \caption{Frequency histogram of total energy consumption on each day.}
    \label{fig:Data}
\end{figure}

From initial inspection, it was clear both distributions the data had a strong 
negative skew with a large number of meters reporting total consumption under 
100 ?? and then outliers up to 1200 ??. This made it difficult to discern 
details in the dataset when only 50 bins were used.

However, the 90\% and 95\% confidence intervals for the mean total consumption 
yields statistically significant results. Table~\vref{table:Mean} records the 
upper and lower bounds for the mean at two different confidence levels.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{llll}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Day} & $\bar{x}$ & 90\% Interval & 95\% Interval \\
        \midrule
        \textbf{Summer} & 31.265 & [30.608, 31.922] & [30.482, 32.048] \\
        \textbf{Winter} & 39.575 & [38.749, 40.402] & [38.591, 40.560] \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Confidence intervals for mean energy consumption on each day.}
    \label{table:Mean}
\end{table}

The mean total energy consumption on the winter day was greater than in the 
summer. Furthermore, the 90\% and 95\% confidence intervals for the population 
means on each day do not overlap. This suggests at the and 5\% significance 
level---the 95\% confidence interval is statistically more significant---thes 
mean total energy consumption of \textit{all} Irish households was greater on 
the winter day.
